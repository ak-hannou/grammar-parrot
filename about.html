            <h2><b>What does this do?</b></h2>

            <h2><b>Why GrammarParrot?</b></h2>
            <p>When you speak with proper grammar, not only will others be interested in and able to understand what you have to say, but they also will be much more likely to see you as intelligent, logical, and educated. On the other hand, speaking in poor grammar may leave others to judge you negatively or fail to take you seriously. This may earn you a less than desirable grade in your education, but it can also affect your job opportunities. Hiring managers across the country cite poor grammar as a reason for not considering a prospective job applicant. </p>
