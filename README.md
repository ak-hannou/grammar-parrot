## Inspiration
Our idea was inspired by Duolingo. We noticed that the main component that the platform was missing was a tool for practicing your conversation skills. Upon learning about AssemblyAI's Speech-to-Text API, we decided that it might be possible to realize this idea ourselves.

## What it does
GrammarParrot allows users to practice their English speaking skills through simulated conversations. The website sends audio files recorded by the user to Assembly, which returns a transcript. The GrammarBot API uses this transcript and returns a list of grammatical errors for the user to review.

## How we built it
The front-end of this website was built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and is hosted on Netlify. The back-end was developed with Python's Flask and is hosted on the Google Cloud platform.

## Challenges we ran into
Hosting a Flask server on Google Cloud, making API calls.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We're proud of our fantastic front-end design and creating a fully-functioning back-end for the first time!

## What we learned
Hosting a Flask server on Google Cloud, making API calls, making animations with JavaScript and CSS, front-end design.

## What's next for GrammarParrot
Expanding to different languages, using a more powerful grammar API, using user-submitted questions, tracking user progress.
