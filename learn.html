          <p class="mb-0"><i>"Every startup should require some justification for its existence and the time spent on it.  In 2018 we realized that the world was still lacking an API for grammar checking that is both accurate and affordable.  State-of-the-art software in this niche costs thousands of dollars per month for a project involving a high volume of submissions. In short, the technology is inaccessible to many companies that need it the most... We wanted to change that. The diverse and abundant digital ecosystem of tools, services, and innovative projects is fueled by libraries and APIs that developers can easily and affordably use. That's what we are about... So we assembled a team of experts in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, and AI with expertise in language models, deep learning, sequence labeling, and natural language parsing. The end result is our free and low-cost spelling and grammar checking API."</i></p>
